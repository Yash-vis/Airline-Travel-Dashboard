# Airline-Travel-Dashboard
This is an interactive Airline Travel Dashboard I created using Power BI to analyze passenger and flight data. The goal of this project was to uncover insights about travel patterns, age demographics, airline revenues, and route performance all presented in a clean, modern dashboard.

What the Dashboard Shows

Total Flights: 1200

Total Passengers: 315K

Revenue breakdown by airline

Key Insights

Singapore Airlines and Delta Airlines lead in total revenue.

Most passengers belong to the 19–30 age group, contributing the highest to Business and Economy class.

Economy class remains the most preferred overall.

Some long-haul routes like Sydney → Paris and Delhi → London generate strong revenue despite lower passenger counts.
